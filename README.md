### Wireframing Strategy

BillSplitX will allow users to choose between radio buttons or input for choosing specific amount of people/tip percent. For choosing the amount of the bill there will be a specific input.

1. Create Radio buttons for choosing amount of people, or allow for input. return a value
2. Create input for cost.
3. Create radio buttons for tip percentages or allow users to choose between percentages or adding directly to the tip by the value provided.
4. Create Reset button to reset all values.
5. If a form is not filled out it will add an alert.
6. Each section will have a Font Awesome Icon to help with visuals.
